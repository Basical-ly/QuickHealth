## Features
### Posture
Posture Reminders gently nudge you to help you maintain a healthy posture and reduce eye strain.
### Breaks
Breaks are regular intervals designed to promote rest and reduce strain. Short Breaks are quick, frequent pauses that help with eye health, while Long Breaks offer deeper, less frequent rests for relaxation and movement.
### 20-20-20
The 20-20-20 rule helps prevent eye strain by encouraging you to look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds every 20 minutes. This simple practice relaxes your eye muscles and reduces discomfort from prolonged screen use.
### Personalize
Settings allow you to customize or disable features like breaks and reminders to fit your preferences. You can adjust timing, duration, and frequency, ensuring the experience is tailored to your needs for optimal comfort and productivity.
### Updates
QuickHealth is still being updated with new features, fixes, and improvements. QuickHealth also automatically checks for updates and notifies you if there is a new one available.
